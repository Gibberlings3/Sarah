<h2>Notes</h2> 
<div class="section"> 
  <p><acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> is rated T for Teen. </p> 
  <p>The Sarah <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Romance Mod
    contains a female/female romance which is considered to be rated T for Teen
    material. Please do not play this mod if this type of content offends you.</p>
	<p><strong>Please Note:</strong> The original SoA version of Sarah, v1.3, is replaced by this download.</p>
    <p><strong>Please uninstall SarahSoA and any prior versions of Sarah before installing this mod. It includes all of that content, and more!</strong></p>	
</div> 
<h2>Overview</h2> 
<div class="section"> 
  <p>It has always been a belief of mine that there are not enough rangers in
    Baldur's Gate II, nor are there enough opportunities to interact with them.
    This mod will add Sarah, a young but independent ranger to Baldur's Gate
    II.</p> 
</div> 
<h2>Compatibility</h2> 
<div class="section"> 
  <p>This mod is designed to work with Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn with
    or without the Throne of Bhaal expansion pack. There are currently no known
    incompatibilities. </p> 
</div> 
<h2>Installation</h2> 
<div class="section"> 
  <p><strong>Windows</strong><br /> 
    The Sarah <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> mod is packaged
    and installed with <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> and
    is distributed as a self-extracting archive. To install, simply double-click
    the archive and follow the instructions on screen.</p> 
  <p>Alternatively the files can be extracted from the archive using <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/">WinRAR</a>.
    If properly extracted, you should have a SarahToB folder and Setup-SarahTob.exe
    in your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder. To install,
    simply double-click Setup-SarahToB.exe and follow the instructions on screen.</p> 
  <p>Please run Setup-SarahToB.exe in your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder
    to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p> 
  <p><strong>Mac OS X</strong><br /> 
    <em>If the mod was previously installed, uninstall it before extracting the
    new version.</em>The Sarah <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> mod
    is packaged and installed with <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>.
    To install, simply extract the contents of the mod into your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder.
    If properly extracted, you should have a SarahToB folder, Setup-SarahToB,
    and Setup-SarahToB.command in your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder.
    To install, simply double-click <strong>Setup-SarahToB.command</strong> and
    follow the instructions on screen.</p> 
	<strong>Linux</strong><br />
Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify. Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="http://www.weidu.org/~thebigg "><acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>.org</a> and copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal, cd to your BG2 installation directory, run 'tolower' and answer Y to both queries.<br />
You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only this mod since the last time you lower cased file name.
If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.<br />
Run <strong>WeInstall sarahtob</strong> in your game folder to install the mod. Then run <strong>wine BGMain.exe</strong> and start playing.</p>

<h2>Contents</h2> 
<div class="section"> 
  <p>Sarah is a young but independent woman who was born in the slums of Baldur's
    Gate. She was raised by her father until he met an untimely death at the
    hands of a mugger when she was thirteen. Sent to live with her uncle, a ranger,
    in the Cloakwood Forest, Sarah learned the ways of nature as well as the
    art of combat. Years later, she left the Cloakwood to explore on her own.
    She settled in an empty cabin not too far from Umar Hills, and has helped
    guide lost merchants and other travelers ever since. Sarah is a relatively
    shy but determined person who admits to loving nature more than people, but
    then again, perhaps she just hasn't found the right person yet. You can find
    Sarah in the northeastern section of the Umar Hills region (AR1100).</p> 
  <p align="left"><strong>This mod will include</strong>:</p>

    <li>Player-initiated dialogues/flirts for romancing <acronym title="Player Characters">PCs</acronym> or
      those who just want to remain friends.</li> 
    <li>Banters with the BioWare <acronym title="Non-Player Characters">NPCs</acronym>. </li> 
    <li>A short but fun quest.</li>
	<li>A few interesting encounters</li>

    <li>A useful ranger who isn't afraid of magic.</li> 
    <li>Numerous interjections.</li> 
    <li>Reactions to the events of the Baldur's Gate II world.</li> 
    <li>An original soundtrack.</li> 
    <li>A beautiful portrait drawn by the talented Ilmatar.</li>

  </ul> 
  <p><strong>Biography</strong></p> 
  <p>When asked about her past, SARAH tells you that she hails from the slums
    of Baldur's Gate, where she raised by her father until he met an untimely
    death at the hands of a mugger when Sarah was thirteen. She was taken in
    by her father's brother, a ranger of the Cloakwood Forest, who taught her
    all he knew of nature and combat. She admits to preferring the company of
    trees over people, but that she has never hesitated to help anyone in need.
    While she claims she is unremarkable and ordinary, you wonder if there is
    more to her than meets the eye.</p>
