<p>It has always been a belief of mine that there are not enough rangers in      Baldur's Gate II, nor are there enough opportunities to interact with them.      This mod will add Sarah, a young but independent ranger to Baldur's Gate      II.</p>
<p><acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> is rated T for Teen. </p>
    <p>The Sarah <acronym title="Non-Player Character">NPC</acronym> Romance Mod      contains a female/female romance which is considered to be rated T for Teen      material. Please do not play this mod if this type of content offends you.</p>
    <p><strong>Please Note:</strong> The original SoA version of Sarah, v1.3, is replaced by this download.</p>
    <p><strong>Please uninstall SarahSoA and any prior versions of Sarah before installing this mod. It includes all of that content, and more!</strong></p>

      <p><strong>Enhanced Editions Note</strong><br />
        The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every   patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a   modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as   even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with   your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a   new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. For BG2:EE it is important that you install the mod to the language   version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod   will not show but give error messages. </p>
      <p><strong>Windows</strong><br />
        Sarah for Windows is distributed as a self-extracting   archive and includes a WeiDU installer. To install, simply double-click   the archive and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, the files can be extracted into your game directory using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a> or <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-sarah.exe</strong> and the folder<strong> sarah</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-sarah.exe</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-sarah.exe</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>Mac OS X</strong><br />
        Sarah  for Mac OS X is distributed as a compressed tarball and includes a WeiDU installer.</p>
      <p>First, extract the files from the tarball into your game directory. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-sarah</strong>, <strong>setup-sarah.command</strong>, and the folder <strong>sarah</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-sarah.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-sarah.command</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>Linux</strong><br />
        Sarah  for Linux is distributed as a compressed tarball and does not include a WeiDU installer.</p>
      <p>Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify.</p>
      <p>Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="https://github.com/WeiDUorg/weidu/releases/latest">WeiDUorg</a> and copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal, cd to your game installation directory, run tolower   and answer Y to both queries. You can avoid running the second option   (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save   time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the   first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only   this mod since the last time you lowercased file names. If you're   unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.</p>
      <p>To install, run WeInstall sarah in your game folder. Then run wine BGMain.exe and start playing. </p>
      <p><strong> Note for Complete Uninstallation</strong><br />
        In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely uninstall the mod using setup-sarah --uninstall at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts. . </p>

<p>Sarah is a young but independent woman who was born in the slums of Baldur's      Gate. She was raised by her father until he met an untimely death at the      hands of a mugger when she was thirteen. Sent to live with her uncle, a ranger,      in the Cloakwood Forest, Sarah learned the ways of nature as well as the      art of combat. Years later, she left the Cloakwood to explore on her own.      She settled in an empty cabin not too far from Umar Hills, and has helped      guide lost merchants and other travelers ever since. Sarah is a relatively      shy but determined person who admits to loving nature more than people, but      then again, perhaps she just hasn't found the right person yet. You can find      Sarah in the northeastern section of the Umar Hills region (AR1100).</p>

  <p><strong>Biography</strong></p>
  <p>When asked about her past, SARAH tells you that she hails from the slums      of Baldur's Gate, where she raised by her father until he met an untimely      death at the hands of a mugger when Sarah was thirteen. She was taken in      by her father's brother, a ranger of the Cloakwood Forest, who taught her      all he knew of nature and combat. She admits to preferring the company of      trees over people, but that she has never hesitated to help anyone in need.      While she claims she is unremarkable and ordinary, you wonder if there is      more to her than meets the eye.    </p>
