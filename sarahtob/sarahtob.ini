# Short description of the mod, main goals, features etc
Description = It has always been a belief of mine that there are not enough rangers in Baldur's Gate II, nor are there enough opportunities to interact with them. This mod will add Sarah, a young but independent ranger to Baldur's Gate II.

The Sarah NPC Romance Mod contains a female/female romance which is considered to be rated T for Teen material. Please do not play this mod if this type of content offends you.

The mod is directly compatible with all BG2 games: BGII, BGT, BGII:EE, and EET.
